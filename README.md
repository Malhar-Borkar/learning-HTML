# learning-HTML
Code I wrote when I was learning and practicing HTML
It contains two folders. One of the files I made during learning HTML and the other containing the files that I created for practice and mastering the basics.
Feel free to suggest any changes or improvements I could have done to make my page/code more efficient or accurate.
